# Network Enumeration

# Become familiar using command line utilities for network enumeration and using Common Vulnerabilities Exposure Database.

In today's current cyber environment, vulnerabilities continue to grow on a regular basis. Every time a new piece of software is developed, new security flaws are discovered in it, and fixing these flaws quickly becomes an absolute must. The Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) database is used for a wide variety of tasks by many types of businesses, experts, and hackers. As a consequence of this, each and every collection of vulnerabilities has been catalogued and submitted to CVE for further investigation and to bring the process to a conclusion. To report the new vulnerability in the CVE database, there are various actions that need to be taken on the CVE database before you can let others know about the newly discovered vulnerability.

The following are some of the steps to report the new vulnerability to the CVE Database:

Step 1: Enter https://cve.mitre.org/ site any browser based on the user requirement. 
Step 2: Go to the “Update a CVE Record” Tab on the top right side of the website.

Step 3: The homepage offers users a wide variety of different choices. You may make a reference to this by supplying the CVE ID whenever you want to request a CVE for reference.
            Step 3.1: You can request the CVE records in various forms such as “Other Contributors”.
            Step 3.2: You can Update the CVE records, there will be necessary instructions and options to update the CVE Records on the webpage.
Step 4: To report the in CVE, select “CVE Program Request forms” under the “Are you a CAN?” section.

Step 5: It will take you to a new page, where you will see a pop-up notice with information about the email address of the CVE database. You should contact them before asking for or filling out any of the required information.

Step 6: You are able to send in the request for the CVE on this webpage. This includes choosing a request type, providing your e-mail address, and submitting a PGP key, among other things ( to encrypt). It is up to the discretion of the user whether or not the encryption should be used while sending a message that is encrypted.

Step 7: Users are required to enter necessary information when they select "Report Vulnerability/Request CVE ID." This includes the number of vulnerability reports, the type of vulnerability, the types of vendors the products belong to, the product's version, and any additional information regarding the vulnerability of the products. 
Step 8: After answering the necessary questions, you can submit a request. 

This procedure offers a helpful suggestion about the process of reporting a vulnerability to the CVE database. The public has access to a number of different alternatives, such as notifying the CVE publication, amending the current CVE entry, and other similar options, which allow them to inform or update the information according to their preferences. This creates a strong basis for experts to build goods by including critical security elements that make the items hack-proof and impenetrable to unauthorized users.


# Network Enumeration

A Network enumeration is a procedure that establishes a reliable connection to the destination or target host in order to investigate potential entry points into the system that might be exploited for malicious purposes. Due to the fact that its findings directly attack the system, it is often employed during the crucial phase of the penetration testing process. Some of the gatherings are DNS details. Network ports, usernames, and group names.

In general, uname command displays information about the system. The output of uname -r offers information on the version of the kernel, whereas the output of uname -a provides information regarding the whole system. The operating system that is being used by the aforementioned computer is Linux. When you run the hostnamectl command without giving any parameters, you will get a summary of the current state of the home. 

These are a few of the commands that may be used to show information about the machine name, the operating system it uses, the name of the server, and other relevant details. Security experts use these commands to investigate and diagnose issues with networks and hosts in order to resolve such issues. On the other side, hackers are also using these instructions in an effort to get into the network or hack into it.

The above screenshots provides the port listening and port closed information.

Netstat is a command line utility that shows the information on network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections and other relevant issues.
Nmap is a tool that is used for network research and security audits that is controlled via the command line. In addition to that, you can use this program to determine which ports on the network are accessible as well as which networks are open and which networks are closed.
The dig command on Linux, which stands for "Domain Information Groper," is used to carry out DNS lookups and provides information on the name server. 
In a similar vein, the host command is a DNK lookup tool that determines the IP address corresponding to a domain name.
Information pertaining to DNS has been investigated by means of the execution of instructions pertaining to enumeration. 
It provided various information about DNS and its related information.
The DNS server version includes a minor vulnerability that is caused by a bug in bind9, which is a program that is regarded as being unstable. The unstable is considered as the issue in the version. The CVSS Score is medium, and the Confidentiality Impact and Integrity Impact are considered as None.
A number of preventative measures are used in order to maintain comments in the Debian extras directory with the appropriate formatting. It is possible to lessen its impact and utilize it for other purposes if additional functionality is provided.
